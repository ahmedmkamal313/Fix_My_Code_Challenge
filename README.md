# 0x00. Fix my code

## Description

This project is a challenge to fix existing code bases in different languages, such as **Python**, **JavaScript**, **Ruby**, and **C**. The code bases are taken from the repository [0x00-Fix_My_Code_Challenge]() by [alx-tools](https://github.com/alx-tools/0x00-Fix_My_Code_Challenge). The **goal** is to learn how to debug and improve code quality by following best practices and standards.
